# COMP340 - CPD

## Week one
Based on my experience with previous terms, my work flow seems to start off really strong in the first few weeks, this is no exception. Straight away we are presented with a deadline in two weeks for the research journal of 350. This is a very soon deadline and I have made sure to commit early and sporadically across the different topics.

## Week two
This week I primarily worked on the wiki for the research journal while starting to write my dissertation literature review. Not much happened this week, I just went through the motions of day-to-day life and didn't get much of anything done at all.

## Week three
First deadline done and out the way, I feel like I managed to contribute an adequate amount to various subjects across the research journal. I'm wondering when we will be given the Product Owner task for the agency? I've been told about it but haven't heard anything from anyone yet. I'm getting a bit worried and have emailed Andy asking for an update.
I went home back to Bude because I was suffering from everything pretty much. Anxiety and depression and I've had enough.

## Week four
I literally did nothing of substance. I was at home trying to recover from mental health issues. Everything is scary and I can't even contemplate leaving the house right now.

## Week five
See above.

## Week six
I'm back! I don't have time for a slow recovery, I threw myself straight back into and am trying to pretend nothing ever happened.
For the first time in a while, I had to get the bus from Falmouth to Penryn. The bus broke down. A bus journey which should take 20 minutes took an hour and a half and I had to do the peer review for COMP350, the optimisation task, from my phone on the bus. I guess it went alright though, I didn't actually have anything substantial to submit though. 

## Week seven
Started looking at working on the Product Owner project with the Agency and mapped out the timeline for when each part of the project will be worked on and/or completed. I'm getting quite concerned that the task given to me of translating a PhP product into a modern version maybe too much for me. My programming skills are worse than sub-par, they are practically non-existent. Hopefully I can get some help from Andy and my peers on this task.

## Week eight
I've developed this strange work ethic where I have to work everyday from 9AM to 5PM otherwise I get very anxious and depressed, but as soon as I hit 5PM I can't do any more work and I will shut off completely until the next day. There's an obvious benefit to this being that I am getting a lot of work done, the drawback is a necessary stressful struggle.

## Week nine
I'm done with collecting research. I only collected 9 samples, which is 55 below the initial intended amount. This is a laughable attempt in all honesty. However, I spoke to Rory and he said that the quantity of the data collected is not important, the reflection and analysis of the data is what creates marks. I will continue to write up this information to my dissertation.

## Week ten
Time really flies, I can't believe I'm almost finished with university. Still feels like first year. I've finished my dissertation and I've sent it to Rory for feedback which I'm eager to amend as soon as possible so I can write the dissertation off as complete. 
The product owner project is a pretty bad disaster. I followed instructions from a youtube video pretty closely and now that I need to add additional features to the project I am really struggling, since there are no longer instructions for it. I guess I never will learn how to program, I'm a sham. I've emailed Andy about it a few times but he doesn't respond.

## Week eleven
